# Hobos

A simple wrapper to return hobos. Sometimes Lorem Ipsum names get boring.

## Why?

Why not? Lorem Ipsum gets old.

## Installation:

```BASH
gem install hobos
```

And now...

```bash
$ hobos
#=> Big-Tipper Silas Fake-Nickel
```

### Awareness
Homelessness is a large problem in the major cities of the United States. This repository in no way is met to make fun of people
who are in the a very weak position societally. I heavily recommend donating to your local homeless shelter, or volunteering time.
There are also great organizations like [Volunteers For America](http://www.voa.org/homeless-people) and [The National Coalition for the Homeless](http://nationalhomeless.org/). To find a shelter in your area you can donate to, check [here](http://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/).
